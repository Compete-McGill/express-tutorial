# Hack4Impact x Compete Mcgill: Express Tutorial

## Requirements:
* [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
  * (Optional but nice to clone project easily)

## Usage:

Make sure you have all of the required dependencies (listed above).

Clone the repository using git or github. Alternatively you can download it as a zip file and unzip it.

Use `cd` to get into your project directory. Then use:

```bash
npm install
```
to install all of the project dependencies.

Start the project with:
```bash
npm start
```

By default it will be running on port 3000, so you can test that it works via:
```bash
curl localhost:3000/todos
```
